Time flies. 23 years old, 1 year post-undergrad, and still so much to figure out. I have a habit of biting off more than I can chew. I suppose I thrive under the pressure, or maybe it's all I know how to do.

I've decided to make some changes in my life. If there's any hope of achieving my loftiest goals, I need discipline enough to execute on my plans. To that end, I am shifting my focus towards continuous improvement of myself.

Less video games, less YouTube, less TV. More sleep, more exercise, more project time. The number one blocker to success is myself, and I cannot let myself continue to focus on the wrong things.

To those who are stuck in a rut, don't force yourself to fix everything that's wrong all at once. Make your goal to get a little better, each and every day.
