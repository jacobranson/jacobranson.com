I set the bar for the work I produce very high, and it is raised every year as my skills improve. As such, I historically have buried projects that I find too "amateurish" for my current standards. The obvious problem with doing that time and time again is that I keep no record of my growth as a developer!

To that end, I am focusing on archiving the work that I have contributed to over the past few years with my friends. The project is called [Cosmic Archive](https://cosmicarchive.org), and there you will soon be able to find everything worth sharing that was created by my friends and I during our college years.

Developers, don't throw away your legacy just because your standards are getting higher. You are improving, it's a good thing!
